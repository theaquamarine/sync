      a consistently visible location.

Wed Oct 16 23:21 2013 CDT

      error message over the chatbox (instead of alert())

Wed Oct 16 23:09 2013 CDT
    * www/assets/js/util.js: Add a special handler so that clicking
      anywhere on the page clears a userlist dropdown, not just right
      clicking the same name.

Wed Oct 16 21:48 2013 CDT
    * www/assets/js/player.js: Add a stupid timeout hack to address
      a race condition in YouTube's HTML5 player.  Seriously?

Wed Oct 16 17:34 2013 CDT
    * lib/utilities.js: Add a "Set" wrapper around objects to represent
      sets.
    * lib/channel.js, lib/user.js: Change the way muting works- muted
      users are stored in a set and are automatically muted when they
      join (this set is not persisted across restarts, however).

Wed Oct 16 17:19 2013 CDT
    * lib/channel.js, lib/user.js: Only kick users on permissions

      claimed it happened).

    * lib/user.js: Fix bad chatMsg packet causing exceptions

Sat Oct 12 15:53 2013 CDT

      lookups from racing with the playlist queue.
    * tests/naokosimulator2013.js: Flood the first 10 videos all at once.
      Should provide better test coverage for race conditions (especially
      on localhost where the latency is ~0)

Mon Oct 07 10:02 2013 CDT
    * lib/channel.js: Fix several cases where an unregistered channel
      might attempt to make a database call which then fails.

Sun Oct 06 01:42 2013 CDT

Thu Oct 03 22:09 2013 CDT
    * www/assets/js/ui.js: Use sortable("cancel") to remove the need for
      the `moveby` field of the movement packet
    * www/assets/js/util.js, www/assets/js/callbacks.js, lib/channel.js:
      Remove references to moveby

      allowed.  If not, send a queueFail.

Fri Sep 27 10:27 2013 CDT
    * lib/channel.js: Change the link regex, change the way 'affects links'
      works.  The default link filter will only transform a link of no

      if 'affects links' is ticked).

    * lib/bgtask.js: Generalize background tasks to this module.  Add
      tasks for statistics tracking and clearing old aliases.
    * lib/database.js: Modify the way aliases work a bit.  Rather than
      constantly deleting to keep 5 aliases per person, have a function
      that is periodically called to delete aliases more than one month old,
      and have the listAliases function explicitly sort and request the most
      recent 5 aliases.
    * lib/server.js: Update references accordingly

Thu Sep 26 23:08 2013 CDT
    * lib/acp.js, lib/api.js, lib/server.js, lib/stats.js, www/acp.html,
      www/assets/js/acp.js: Remove the [realtime] 'connection stats'
      tracking that was pretty worthless anyways.

Thu Sep 26 21:42 2013 CDT

      video and use this information to prevent the player restarting when
      it receives an out of range timestamp

      the paginator was being duplicated

Tue Sep 24 13:45 2013 CDT
    * lib/acp.js: Emit announcements to SSL sockets in addition to regular
      ones.

      search result- prevents buttons being incorrectly added or omitted.

Mon Sep 23 16:22 2013 CDT
    * lib/user.js: distinguish search result return packets with a 'source'
      field that specifies where the item came from (e.g 'yt' for youtube
      search, 'library' for library search)
    * www/assets/js/callbacks.js: account for the change in lib/user.js
      which adds a 'source' field to library search results
    * www/assets/js/util.js: don't add delete buttons for youtube search
      results.  Apparently people keep clicking them...

Sat Sep 21 23:53 2013 CDT
    * lib/playlist.js, www/assets/js/player.js: Modify the server lead
      function to have a 3 second lead-in period (to allow buffering).
      Videos start at -3 seconds; the client is paused until the time
      reaches 0 seconds.

Sat Sep 21 02:21 2013 CDT
    * www/assets/js/ui.js, www/assets/js/ui.js, www/assets/js/util.js,

      modflair and adminflair

Sat Sep 21 00:29 2013 CDT

      arbitrarily high)

Sat Sep 21 00:23 2013 CDT
    * www/assets/js/callbacks.js, www/assets/css/ytsync.css: make it more

      in the pre-patched channel code

Wed Sep 11 22:13 2013 CDT
    * lib/channel.js, lib/user.js: Remove "afkers" array, replace afkcount

      Add a user option to enable SSL for websockets and API calls
    * www/assets/js/ui.js: Add a warning if the user loaded the page over
